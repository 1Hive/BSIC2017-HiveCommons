# What is Hive Commons

Hive Commons is a activism community that enables users to pool their resources together into a shared commons, with access to the commons contingent upon usage being in the best interest of the community.

In the event of a dispute over what constitutes the best interest of the community, members of the community participate in decentralized arbitration process, that is functionally similiar to liquid democracy.

Ultimately, as the resources within the commons grow, the community will have more leverage for collective bargaining and as a community will have a greater voice to make change.
