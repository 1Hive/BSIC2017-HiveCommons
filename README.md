# Welcome!

If your new or not sure what Hive Commons is or aims to be, please read our [introductory post on medium](https://medium.com/hive-commons/introducing-hive-commons-95dad77814bb). 

## Who can help?
You can. Hive Commons is a grass-roots organization and everyone who believes in the mission can and should participate in the realization of the communities shared goal. Whether that means joining the conversation and spreading the ideas, or getting more active in development and infrastructure. Here are some specific skills that would be extremely helpful to the project at it current stage. 

### Solidity Development
To realize the vision of Hive Commons the community will need to build, audit, and, test several smart contracts. Tokens, Voting and Arbitration, Escrow, Bounties, and Reserve contracts are all core components of the project. 

### Web3.0 Frontend Development
The [1Hive community portal](https://github.com/HiveCommons/1Hive) is a web3.0 enabled interface that will enable direct community engagement with Hive Commons. 

### UX and Graphic Design
 Hive Commons goal is to attract a community of users who may not have even heard of cryptocurrency, making the 1Hive portal and community websites and general outward facing elements of the project as friendly as possible will be imperative to the success of the project. 

### Legal Expertise
Decentralized blockchain governance is an emerging area and there are many uncertainties about how it fits into existing laws and regulatory guidelines its important that the project has a strong understanding of the implications of these things are to ensure the long-term success of the project. In the short-term setting up a legal non-profit entity, drafting and reviewing the proposed Hive Commons License for open source developers is mission critical. 

### Not sure you fit in any of those categories?
Even if you don’t have any of the above skillsets, if you want help, I can guarantee that you have something to contribute—Sharing ideas, poking holes in existing  plans, and generally discussion the project are all important contributions as well. 

**So whatever your skillset is, join the community and get involved.** We are on [Github](https://github.com/HiveCommons), [Medium](https://medium.com/hive-commons), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HiveCommons/), and [Slack](https://hivecommons.herokuapp.com).
